# Sketchpad

This is an [exercise](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch) proposed in the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

It is a sketchpad where the user can draw by moving the mouse over it. The more the mouse goes over a space, the darker it becomes.

Some functionalities that were not in the exercise description were added, like an eraser and an input element to change the number of rows and columns in the pad.
